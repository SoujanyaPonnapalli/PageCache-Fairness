# cgroup_isolated.ini
# Complete resource isolation between steady and bursty clients
# Each client gets dedicated cores, isolated memory, and independent I/O
#
# NUMA-aware CPU pinning (recommended for multi-socket systems):
# To check your NUMA topology: lscpu | grep NUMA
# To see core-to-node mapping: numactl --hardware
# Example topologies:
#   - Interleaved: node0={0,2,4,...}, node1={1,3,5,...}
#   - Sequential: node0={0-19}, node1={20-39}
